## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

# Types Of Libraries

LibTypes of libs There are many different types of libraries in a workspace. In order to maintain a certain sense of order, we recommend having only the below four (4) types of libraries:

- **Feature libraries**: Developers should consider feature libraries as libraries that implement smart UI (with injected services) for specific business use cases or pages in an application.

- **UI libraries**: A UI library contains only presentational components.

- **Data-access** libraries: A data-access library contains services and utilities for interacting with a back-end system. It also includes all the code related to State management.

- **Utility libraries**: A utility library contains common utilities and services used by many libraries and applications.

Why do we make these distinctions between libraries? Good question! It is good to set boundaries for what a library should and should not do. This demarcation makes it easier to understand the capabilities of each library, and how they interact with each other.

More concretely, we can form rules about what each types of libraries can depend on. For example, UI libraries cannot use feature or data-access libraries, because doing so will mean that they are effectful.

## Generate an application

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@vitaba/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `ng build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
